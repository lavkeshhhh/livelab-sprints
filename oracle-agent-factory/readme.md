# Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory Sprints

Welcome to the **Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory** LiveLabs workshop. This repository contains the source code and instructions for building intelligent agents that interact with your enterprise infrastructure.

## Workshop Sprints
This workshop consists of three sequential sprints, each designed to take approximately 15 minutes:

### 1. [Database Actions Orchestrator](database-actions-orchestrator/sprint/db-actions-orchestrator.md)
Build a master orchestrator agent that coordinates specialized sub-agents (Security, Schema, Data) to perform safe, natural-language database operations.

### 2. [Linux Compute/VM Agent](linux-compute-vm-agent/sprint/linux-compute-agent.md)
Create an infrastructure agent capable of executing CLI commands, checking system health, and managing Linux VMs securely via an MCP server.

### 3. [Kubernetes Control Agent](kubernetes-control-agent/sprint/k8s-control-agent.md)
Develop a cloud-native agent to inspect, monitor, and control OKE clusters and deployments using natural language.

## Getting Started
To begin, navigate to the [Introduction](introduction/index.md) page or start directly with the first sprint.

## Requirements
*   Oracle Cloud Account with Agent Factory access.
*   A running MCP Server instance (refer to the prerequisites in each sprint).
