# Introduction

## About this Workshop
The **Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory** empowers you to build specialized, secure AI agents that interact with your enterprise infrastructure. This workshop guides you through creating four distinct types of agents using the Agent Factory's visual interface and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

You will learn how to orchestrate complex database operations, manage compute instances, monitor Kubernetes clusters, and query complex ERP systems—all through natural language.

**Estimated Time: 60 minutes**

### Objectives
In this workshop, you will build four powerful agents:
1.  **Database Actions Orchestrator**: A master agent that coordinates specialized sub-agents (Security, Schema, Data) to perform safe database operations.
2.  **Linux Compute/VM Agent**: An infrastructure agent that connects to your OCI/On-prem environment to monitor and manage Linux VMs via CLI commands.
3.  **Kubernetes Control Agent**: A cloud-native agent that inspects and controls OKE clusters, deployments, and pods.
4.  **Oracle EBS Agent**: An integration agent that connects via an SSH bridge to query complex E-Business Suite ERP data using 11 specialized, read-only SQL tools.

### Prerequisites
This workshop assumes you have:
*   An Oracle Cloud Account.
*   Access to the Oracle Agent Factory environment.
*   Basic familiarity with Database, Linux, and Kubernetes concepts.
*   Understanding of AI Agents and LLMs.
